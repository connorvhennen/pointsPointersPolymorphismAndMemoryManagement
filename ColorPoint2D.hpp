/** @class ColorPoint2D
 @brief Describes the position of a 2D point with two variables of type double, and the color of the point with a variable of type string
 
 This class is designed to inherit the properties of the Point2D class, and contain an additional property that describes the point's color. It contains inherited variables for the position of a 2D point, its own variable for the color of a 2D, and its own print function, which accesses the print function of the base Point2D class.
