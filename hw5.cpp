@brief Prompts user to create objects of type Point2D, ColorPoint2D and WeightedPoint2D, and then outputs the created objects

 The main function will introduce the user to the object types available and then creates as many of these objects as the user wants, displaying the user input as they go along and finally outputting all of the created objects when the user has finished. The main function utilizing polymorphism, while managing memory through the Resource Acquisition is Initialization technique. In particular, the user created objects are stored via Point2D pointers pushed back to a Points object vector, where the pointers can point to objects of all the available types (polymorphism), and are deconstructed automatically.
